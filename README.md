JSON Matcher is a Go (_golang_) library to verify conformance of JSON objects to a
desired structure, according to provided patterns.

This is especially useful when writing unit-/integration- tests where exact comparisons
won't be viable (because some parts are particularly dynamic, think about
current timestamps, JWT tokens, UUIDs, ...).

For example, suppose you have a JSON API response like the following:

```json
{
  "id": "adb43c69-f8d9-4108-a2da-d740a2a800ec",
  "title": "A short article.",
  "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, ...",
  "publish": true,
  "type": "articles",
  "created": "2022-07-20T09:56:29.000Z",
  "updated": "2022-07-20T10:12:47.000Z",
  "section_id": 42,
  "tags": [ "society", "essays", "history" ]
}
```

you could check the above structure with (error checks omitted here for brevity, you should check errors in actual code):

```go
matches, _ := matcher.JSONMatches(responseString, `{
  "id": "#uuid",
  "title": "#string",
  "body": "#string",
  "publish": "#boolean",
  "type": "articles",
  "created": "#datetime",
  "updated": "#datetime",
  "section_id": "#number",
  "tags": [ "#array-of", "#string" ],
  "error": "#notpresent"
}`)
if !matches {
    // ...
}
```

## ðŸš€ Install

Using JSON Matcher is easy. Use `go get` to install the latest version of the library:

```shell
go get github.com/panta/go-json-matcher@latest
```

then import the library in you application:

```go
import "github.com/panta/go-json-matcher"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

The function `JSONMatches()` checks that the JSON string provided with the first
argument satisfies the pattern specified with the second argument.
The pattern can be a valid literal value (in that case an exact match will be required),
a special marker beginning with a `#` character as described below, or any combination
of these via arrays and objects.

### Supported markers

Marker | Description
------ | -----------
`#ignore` | Ignore the value or field
`#null` | Requires that the value is `null` (the element must be present though) 
`#notnull` | Requires that the value is not `null`
`#present` | Requires that the value is present (but it may be `null`)
`#notpresent` | Requires that the value is NOT present (not even `null`)
`#array` | Requires the value to be an array
`#object` | Requires the value to be an object
`#boolean` | Requires the value to be a boolean (either `true` or `false`)
`#number` | Requires the value to be a number
`#string` | Requires the value to be a string
`#uuid` | Requires the value to be a string conforming to a UUID
`#uuid-v4` | Requires the value to be a string conforming to a V4 UUID according to [RFC4122](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)
`#date` | Requires the value to be a string representing a valid ISO8601 date (format _YYYY-MM-DD_)
`#datetime` | Requires the value to be a string representing a valid RFC3339 / ISO8601 datetime
`#regex RE` | Requires the value to be a string matching the regular expression provided in `RE`
